# Projekti-open-data-kosovo

Hello!

This is a project that was assigned to me to test my abilities on markup languages that i got from the training that was organized by the company "Open Data Kosovo", by creating a webiste about popular authors.

This was the very first website that i created in my path of becoming a Web Developer, so i will keep it the same as it is with no intention of improving it.

When i become a Web Developer i will look back at how it started and how it is going (in the future).

Thank you for your time!
